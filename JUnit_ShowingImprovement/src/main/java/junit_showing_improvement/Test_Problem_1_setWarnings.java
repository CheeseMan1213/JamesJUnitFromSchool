 *This is me taking some code from college and reviewing some things I learned in college. 
 *This stuff is from my Software Testing class.
 *
 *I will be showing myself, and maybe later others, some improvements made to JUnit over the years
 *I took pictures of source code at home on my phone and looked at those pictures on my phone at work.
 *
 * Works Cited:
 * --My own HW assignments
 * --My teacher's practice code*/
